## 1. Which point(s) were new to you?
### some new points for me:
- Use screenshots, diagrams, screencasts tools like loom to show and explain.
- Use Github gists to share code snippets. Use sandbox environments like Codepen, Codesandbox to share the entire setup.
- Look at the way issues get reported in large open-source projects.

## 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
Area that I need to improve "Stuck? Ask questions"
### Ideas to improve:
#### Gather-requirements-properly: 
    To start taking Minutes of Meeting (MOM) during the calls, inorder to not miss any requirements and seeking clarity if needed.
#### Over-Communicate: 
    To always over communicate and to create dedicated channels to hold regular meetings for better team updates and issue resolution.
#### Ask Questions: 
To ask clear and detailed questions with visuals and code snippets for effective problem-solving.
