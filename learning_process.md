* Set aside time for practice and avoid distractions with tools like Boosted or Freedom.
* Learn with curiosity and enjoy the process to make it easier and more fun.
* Focus on truly understanding concepts and applying them in practice.
* Speak up about any challenges or difficulties to stay on track.
